# Styling Notes

Spring calls for lightness and movement. This look combines a romantic blouse with high-waisted linen pants for a sophisticated yet relaxed vibe. The key is balancing feminine details with clean, structured pieces.

The pastel pink creates a fresh, approachable feel while the neutral linen keeps it grounded. Add delicate gold jewelry to elevate the look without overwhelming the softness.

**Perfect for:** Weekend brunch, garden parties, casual dates, spring markets

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: When wearing pastels, keep makeup natural and dewy for a cohesive spring aesthetic
- **Tip 2**: Choose one statement piece—here it's the blouse—and let everything else complement it
- **Tip 3**: Linen pants are spring's best friend but wrinkle easily, embrace the relaxed texture or steam before wearing
