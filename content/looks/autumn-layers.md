# Styling Notes

Fall fashion is all about mastering the art of layering. This look combines a chunky knit cardigan over a simple turtleneck, paired with high-waisted trousers for a polished yet comfortable ensemble.

The camel and cream color palette evokes the warmth of autumn while remaining sophisticated and versatile. The oversized cardigan adds coziness without sacrificing style, and the tucked turtleneck creates a flattering silhouette.

**Perfect for:** Coffee dates, autumn walks, casual Fridays, farmers markets

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: Layer different knit weights—a thin turtleneck under a chunky cardigan creates dimension
- **Tip 2**: Earth tones are fall's signature, but don't be afraid to mix warm and cool browns
- **Tip 3**: Keep accessories minimal with layered looks to avoid overwhelming the outfit
