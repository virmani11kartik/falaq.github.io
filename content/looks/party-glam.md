# Styling Notes

When it's time to make an entrance, nothing beats a statement piece. This sequined blazer over a sleek slip dress creates the perfect balance between edgy and elegant—party-ready while maintaining sophistication.

The key is mixing textures: structured blazer, silky slip dress, and metallic accessories. This creates visual interest and elevates the look beyond basic party attire.

**Perfect for:** Cocktail parties, holiday events, birthdays, girls' night out

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: Balance a statement top with simpler bottoms—let one piece be the star
