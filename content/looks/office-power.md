# Styling Notes

Professional doesn't mean boring. This look pairs a classic blazer with modern wide-leg trousers and a silk camisole, creating a sophisticated outfit that commands respect while staying current.

The neutral palette is intentional—it's versatile, timeless, and puts the focus on fit and quality. The oversized blazer adds a contemporary edge while maintaining professionalism.

**Perfect for:** Important meetings, presentations, job interviews, networking events

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: Invest in quality basics—a great blazer and trousers will serve you for years
- **Tip 2**: The "third piece" rule: blazer + trousers + silk cami creates instant polish
- **Tip 3**: Neutral doesn't mean dull—play with different shades of beige, cream, and tan
