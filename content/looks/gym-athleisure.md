# Styling Notes

Athleisure has evolved beyond the gym. This coordinated set proves that workout clothes can be stylish enough to wear throughout your day. The matching set creates a put-together look while staying comfortable.

The neutral earth tones are versatile and flattering, while the high-quality fabrics ensure you look polished whether you're actually working out or just running errands. Layer with an oversized hoodie or denim jacket for street wear.

**Perfect for:** Gym sessions, yoga class, pilates, running errands, casual weekends
