# Styling Notes

Nothing says summer like an all-white ensemble. This look pairs a relaxed linen shirt with flowing wide-leg pants, creating effortless sophistication perfect for seaside strolls or beachside dinners.

The beauty of this look is in the textures—combining structured linen with soft, flowing fabric creates visual interest while keeping things breezy. Minimal accessories let the clean silhouette shine.

**Perfect for:** Beach vacations, coastal walks, sunset dinners, yacht parties

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: White-on-white works best with different textures—mix linen, cotton, and flowing fabrics
- **Tip 2**: Keep undergarments nude or white to maintain the crisp aesthetic
- **Tip 3**: Add a pop of gold jewelry or tan accessories to warm up the all-white palette
