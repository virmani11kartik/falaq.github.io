# Styling Notes

Travel outfits need to work hard—comfortable for long flights yet stylish enough for impromptu photos. This look masters the balance with stretchy joggers, a soft tee, and an elevated trench coat.

The layering is strategic: easy to adjust for temperature changes, comfortable for sitting, and polished enough that you feel put together. Slip-on shoes are essential for airport security.

**Perfect for:** Flights, road trips, train journeys, airport lounges

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: Choose pieces with stretch—you'll be sitting for hours and need comfort
- **Tip 2**: Layer strategically so you can adjust to changing temperatures
- **Tip 3**: Slip-on shoes are a must for airport security but choose ones that look polished
