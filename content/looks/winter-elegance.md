# Styling Notes

Winter doesn't mean sacrificing style for warmth. This monochromatic look features a luxurious wool coat over sleek black separates, creating a timeless, elegant silhouette that works from day to night.

The magic is in the tailoring—a well-fitted coat is winter's most important investment. Paired with streamlined pieces underneath, it creates a polished, put-together look that feels effortless.

**Perfect for:** Holiday parties, winter dinners, office events, city walks

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: Invest in a quality wool coat—it's the foundation of your winter wardrobe
- **Tip 2**: Monochrome dressing elongates your silhouette and looks instantly sophisticated
- **Tip 3**: Add texture with different fabrics (wool, cashmere, leather) to keep all-black interesting
