# Styling Notes

Sometimes the best outfits are the simplest. This combination of well-fitted jeans, a classic white tee, and an oversized blazer proves that casual doesn't mean sloppy. It's the foundation of a great everyday wardrobe.

The magic is in the fit and quality—perfectly fitting jeans, a structured blazer, and the right accessories elevate basics into a polished look you'll reach for again and again.

**Perfect for:** Running errands, coffee with friends, casual Fridays, weekend activities

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: The "elevated basics" formula: great jeans + simple tee + structured third piece
- **Tip 2**: White sneakers or loafers make casual looks feel intentional, not thrown together
- **Tip 3**: A good blazer transforms any outfit from casual to polished instantly
