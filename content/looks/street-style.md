# Styling Notes

Street style is about attitude as much as clothing. This look pairs a leather jacket with high-waisted denim and chunky boots for an effortlessly cool vibe that photographs beautifully.

The monochrome palette with black and denim is timeless, while the oversized jacket and chunky accessories add contemporary edge. It's the perfect formula for looking like you didn't try too hard.

**Perfect for:** City exploring, concerts, coffee shop hangs, shopping days

## Tips

- **Tip 1**: A good leather jacket is worth the investment—it elevates everything
- **Tip 2**: Mix high and low—pair investment pieces with accessible basics
- **Tip 3**: Confidence is everything in street style—own your look
